      <div class="context">
        This project is to create a cloud platform for fashion enthusiasts.
        It combined cloud storage and social features in one place. Users can
        leverage the convenience to inspire others while getting inspirations
        at the same time.
      </div>

      <div class="title">PROBLEM</div>
      <div class="context">
        Cloud storage service is vital. Although several big names already
        exist in the market, there is still space hasn’t been covered.
        We have search engines to provide materials; we have forums to gather
        people with common interests; we have tools to collaborate. How can we
        do everything in one space?
      </div>

      <div class="title">SOLUTION</div>
      <div class="context">
        VIVID aims to gather people with the same interest and to provide a
        simple yet intuitive experience for users save, share and collaborate.
        I created a fashion-related them for the branding, to make the product
        distinctive from the cloud storage market.

      <div class="context">
        Some fashion-related content sharing platforms are targeted as
        competitors; every app provides their unique value to users. However,
        users need to go over different platforms to fulfill their needs. The
        application could be more valuable to users if it can include all core
        features in one place. Another essential is to integrate with other
        platforms to allow users to utilize their content seamlessly.

            Stylebook is made for creating fashion journals, but it doesn’t provide
            cloud storage and share feature. Lookbook’s social networking feature
            allows users to discover inspiration easily; however, the user interface
            is not intuitive and out-dated. WEAR comes with built-in shopping
            feature which is convenient.

        Based on the result of the conducted user survey and also the

         needs of our target users. One is a creative individual intends to
         social and express her fashion opinions; the other one is a professional
          editor wants to enhance the efficiency of the team and to influence
          more audience.

        Visualized user flows can also help to simplify the process of users

        informed multiple iterations of flow design.

      <div class="subtitle">Branding</div>
      <div class="context">
        Fashion is dynamic, creative and unpredictable. To avoid conflicts with
        the user-generated content, I try to keep the container neutral and
        straightforward. I decided to use VIVID as the brand name. VIVID has
        the meaning of sharp, bright and outstanding. It represents the vision
        of fashion influencers subtly. As all fashion enthusiasts want their
        style to be VIVID.
        <br><br>
        Therefore, I came up with two major designs for the logo; one is only
        using the printed name of the brand. Another one is the initial 'v'
        inside a circle, looks just like a stamp. I also want to keep the brand
        as neutral as possible.
        <br><br>
        Simple, Trendy and Minimalist are the three words to represent VIVID.
        <br><br>
        Besides the cleaning looking logo, I used the Morandi color palette to
        create the color palette of this brand. Earth tone colors are trending
        these years; they have a contrast between each other but matching
        subtly with the shade of gray.
        <br><br>
        Two typefaces are chosen to present VIVID. Nixie One is the typeface
        for headlines; Open Sans is for context. Serif typeface enhances the
        awareness of headlines; San Serif typeface makes paragraphs more
        comfortable to read.

            content.

      <div class="subtitle">User Testing</div>
      <div class="context">
        In addition to gathering feedback via Usabilityhub surveys from the
        Internet, I performed tests in person as well. I observed the process
        as they moved through the prototype and interviewed the testers afterward.
        <br><br>
        They suggested adding a sorting feature for users better to find out
        their desire files, and some minor changes to the visual design.
        <br><br>
        Here is one of the examples of how users’ feedbacks led my project to
        the final stage.
        <br><br>
        Changes happened in the iterations.
        <br>
        Changed the logo to brand name for brand image enhancement.
        <br>
        I have enhanced the accent colors to avoid misunderstanding of disabled
        buttons.
        <br>
        I have enlarged the size of buttons and font, increasing the ease of use.
        <br>
        I have used different color and large icon for folders to different
        folders and files.
      </div>

      <div class="title">CONCULSION</div>
      <div class="context">
        By conducting usability tests and preferences tests, users gave me
        useful feedbacks that led me how to improve the design. User’s feedback
        is the key to success.
      </div>
      <div class="context">
        Although research is always the first step in the design process,
        designers use their first instinct to adapt the research result into
        their design. When designers think it is straightforward and easy to
        understand, it may not apply to the users in the same way. The
        usability test is inevitable.
